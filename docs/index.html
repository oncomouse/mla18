<h3 id="two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor Authentication</h3>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Two-factor authentication is a login system that requires you to use <em>two</em> different means of authenication. Usually this is one you know (a password) and one you keep with you (a cellphone or an RSA cryptographic token)</p>

<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Two-factor can be a bit inconvenient (and don’t forget your authentication token at home!), but it really does increase your security and is essential on any email address that may contain sensitive information.</p>

<h3 id="password-managers">Password Managers</h3>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A password manager stores your passwords in a secure blob on a remote server. Many of the best (ie. non-free) password managers offer browser extensions that will fill in password and other information (such as credit cards) for you. Most claim that they do not have plaintext of any data you store in them.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Beyond storing your passwords, the best practice is to use a built-in password generator to create random, long passwords for your various services (usually as long as a service will allow you to use) and let the password manager track them for you. Then, you use an equally long but more memorable password to access your password manager (also, I find it’s best to not use a password manager for any passwords you have to type frequently, such as a university account).</p>

      <li>A famous <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">XKCD comic strip</a> outlined a more secure algorithm for generating long, secure passwords. Use this to generate your password manager master password and any other passwords you enter frequently by hand (university or computer logins).</li>

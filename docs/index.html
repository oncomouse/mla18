We want to answer your questions about information security: how should I be securing my data? Should I be worried? What are best practices? Where can I learn more?</p> <p>We will go over the basics of information security, including what it is and how encryption, the main tool of information security, works. We will also talk about practical approaches to analyzing how much security you may need. After that, we plan to turn it over to your questions, concerns, and ideas.</p> <ol class=pl4> <li>What is Information Security? <ul> <li>What is Encryption?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Why Should <em>I</em> Care? <ul> <li>Threat Modeling</li> </ul> </li> <li>What Can I Do? <ul> <li>Your Questions</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h2 class=lh-title id=resources>Resources</h2> <h3 class=lh-title id=two-factor-authentication>Two-Factor Authentication</h3> <p class=pl4><strong>Definition</strong>: Two-factor authentication is a login system that requires you to use <em>two</em> different means of authenication. Usually this is one you know (a password) and one you keep with you (a cellphone or an RSA cryptographic token)</p> <p class=pl4><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Two-factor can be a bit inconvenient (and don’t forget your authentication token at home!), but it really does increase your security and is essential on any email address that may contain sensitive information.</p> <ul class=pl4> <li><a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/">Google 2-Step Authentication</a></li> <li><a href="https://gateway.tamu.edu/duo-enroll/">NetID Two-Factor Authentication</a> <ul> <li>Sample University Account Enrollment Page</li> <li>Check if your university has a similar program!</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915">Apple Two-Factor Authentication</a></li> </ul> <h3 class=lh-title id=password-managers>Password Managers</h3> <p class=pl4><strong>Definition:</strong> A password manager stores your passwords in a secure blob on a remote server. Many of the best (ie. non-free) password managers offer browser extensions that will fill in password and other information (such as credit cards) for you. Most claim that they do not have plaintext of any data you store in them.</p> <p class=pl4><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Beyond storing your passwords, the best practice is to use a built-in password generator to create random, long passwords for your various services (usually as long as a service will allow you to use) and let the password manager track them for you. Then, you use an equally long but more memorable password to access your password manager (also, I find it’s best to not use a password manager for any passwords you have to type frequently, such as a university account).</p> <ul class=pl4> <li><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2407168,00.asp">PC Magazine’s roundup of Best Password Managers</a> <ul> <li>They like <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a>, <a href="https://www.stickypassword.com/">Sticky Password Manager</a>, and <a href="https://keepersecurity.com/">Keeper</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>I’ve used <a href="https://www.lastpass.com">LastPass</a> forever, but it is a bit confusing to set up.</li> <li><a href="http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/">XKCD Password Generator</a> <ul> <li>A famous <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">XKCD comic strip</a> outlined a more secure algorithm for generating long, secure passwords.
